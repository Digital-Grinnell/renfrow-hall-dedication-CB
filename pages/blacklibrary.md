## Origins
## Demands for a Black Library
One of the 10 demands included in the Black Manifesto was the creation of a Black Library in Burling. In addition to books, the CBS activists wanted the Black Library to include audiovisual equipment specifically for the use of Black students. 

This was not the first time CBS advocated for a Black Library. In 1968, CBS proposed that $400 of the SGA money go to creating a Black Library.

## Developments
## Inital Library Response
At first, the library made a paltry attempt at meeting the demand for a Black Library. Three shelves near the front of the library was populated with 50-odd Black Studies books. This was far from the Black Library CBS had envisioned.
