## About Grinnell College Black Library 

The Black Library is more than a simple speciality section of the library; itâ€™s a result of incredible student activism by Grinnell students, aimed at promoting greater social justice, representation, and equality in the library.  Located on the second floor of Burling Library, the Black Library houses a small portion of scholarship and writings by African and African American scholars. 

## About this collection

This collection serves three purposes. First, this site aims to share the story of the Black Library and highlight the work of the student activists involved. Second, the website serves as companion to the physical exhibit about the Black Library, located on the East side of the Black Library. The website will allow the visitors of the Black Library to take a deeper dive into the history and materials surronding the Black Library. Third, this website serves as a test of CollectionBuilder and its potential as a tool to create digital collections from Grinnell College's materials, specifically the digitized items found in Digital Grinnell.
